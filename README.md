# InstructIRBot

Hi,
In one of my projects, I needed to use InstructIR in the form of a Telegram bot.
InstructIR takes as input an image and a human-written instruction for how to improve that image. The neural model performs all-in-one image restoration. InstructIR achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement.
I share this code so that it might be useful for others✌️
